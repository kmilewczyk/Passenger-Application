# Passenger-Application

The Passenger application is a program written during the video tutorials made by Piotr Gankiewicz. This repo is the code of the workshop (up until episode 22) but rewritten to accommodate the ASP.NET 6. The original source code can be found [here](https://github.com/passenger-stack/Passenger).
